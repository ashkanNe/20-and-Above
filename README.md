# 20-and-Above

Created by Alyssa Gowan and Ashkan Neshagaran in Madison Academic Magnet High School's Programming 2 class in the Fall semester. Inspired by current events occuring in their lives, Ashkan and Alyssa wanted to make an ACT app that will make studying for the important test less stressful and more convienent. Now users can glance at their phone where ever they're at so they can get the most out of their free time.
