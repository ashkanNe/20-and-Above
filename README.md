# 20-and-Above

Created by Alyssa Gowan and Ashkan Neshagaran in Madison Academic Magnet High School's Programming 2 class in the Fall semester. Inspired by current events occuring in their lives, Ashkan and Alyssa wanted to make an ACT app that will make studying for the important test less stressful and more convienent. Now users can glance at their phone where ever they're at so they can get the most out of their free time.

This app was created by Alyssa Gowan and Ashkan Neshagaran for the purpose of helping other people study for the ACT. We took this challenge up in our Programming 2 class at Madison Academic. This app was a product of our collaboration over approximately one month. We hope you enjoy it!

We chose to imitate the nature of standardized testing by making it somewhat unpredictable to prepare our users to whatever obstacles they may face while taking the test. We divided our app into two main sections, the first being our tip section. We teach the user tips and tricks which they can use for the test. Our second section is the ACT practice portion, which is compiled with practice questions from the official ACT website.

Our color scheme imitates the colors of the ACT and America because we are patriotic and we care about the children of this great nation (unlike our competitors). We chose these colors to make our app as similar to the ACT website's scheme to make it look as professional and official as possible. We also thought it looked best out of all the mockups we drew.

Our title is 'Twenty and Above' because we guarantee a 20 or above on the ACT after using our app. We are that confident that our app will help raise our users' scores. We originally wanted to make our app 'One and Above', but we decided that our quality is so good that we can guarantee a 20 and above.

We wanted our logo to be as creative as possible but professional at the same time. After a long time of drafting logo concepts, we agreed that the logo we provided for the app would be the best we could come up with under the time constraints.

Our team consists of two members: Alyssa Gowan, our chief mobile software specialist, and Ashkan, our chief mobile design innovator. Alyssa organized the layout and the general functionality of the app, and Ashkan created the app idea and handled front-end design, including the logo and color scheme. Although we gave ourselves these specific titles, we collaborated on both ends of the spectrum and that's how we created such a great app.
